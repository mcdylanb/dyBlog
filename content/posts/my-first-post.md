# Why Start a Blog
- first job arrived at a support role
  - didn't expect as the preperation was to work in dev
- support is totally different from a developer
- advantages of support
    - understand the user
    - learn data correction
    - learn debugging
    - learn user relation
- sadly ive realized this wasnt for me
  - thanks for my proj manager i was given the opportunity to move to development
- but had no regret
  - as we should see every situation an opportunity to learn
  - and because of me passing through such face ive realized what i like more
