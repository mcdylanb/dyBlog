<p>Grinded non-stop 6 months , finally landed a job in a well known tech company here in the Philippines</p>
<h3 id="i-had-expectations">I Had Expectations:<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#i-had-expectations">#</a></h3>
<p>As I was inspired by some known software engineer vloggers in Youtube
I expected to solve problems then build the fix and make it a reality<br>
As what i learned during my 6 month sprint I expected what i was learning was what i was going to experience in work too</p>
<h3 id="rolled-in-as-a-support">Rolled in as a support<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#rolled-in-as-a-support">#</a></h3>
<p>I expected I was to develop some JS as I got in as a Node JS developer</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>I was placed in a boot camp that was teaching a software called IBM MAXIMO had little to no code (during my bootcamp)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>when got rolled in to my project I was rolled in as a support</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Basically we had the following tasks:</p>
<ul>
<li>there were reocurring task like capturing logs, inventory snapshot and etc..</li>
<li>then there were tickets handling
<ul>
<li>tickets that been sent out from users stating an unexpected event during their time using the software</li>
<li>as supports its our task to investigate what happened , why it occured, and how to prevent this error to reoccur</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>issues were more like queries of users asking why this and some were as easy as data correction</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="sadly-ive-realized-this-wasnt-for-me">Sadly I&rsquo;ve Realized This Wasnt For Me<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#sadly-ive-realized-this-wasnt-for-me">#</a></h2>
<p>Near a year i&rsquo;ve been debating myself if this was what i wanted for months i have kept it to my self.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Which backfired me to close to burnout even have plans to resign on my first job without even reaching a year!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Luckily I had coworkers who checked in on me time to time especially on times I seemed off : with that I had the encouragement to open up my feelings with proj manger</p>
<h3 id="the-little-chat-with-my-project-manager">The Little Chat with My Project Manager:<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#the-little-chat-with-my-project-manager">#</a></h3>
<p>Opened up, right at the start of the conversation, as I was told before to remove the heavy stone first.</p>
<p>He started off thanking me for oppening up</p>
<p>Because most people dont open up and aren&rsquo;t aware we can actually take action to fix like</p>
<ul>
<li>moving to a different project that has the tech I wanted to work</li>
<li>or stay in the same proj but transfer to a different team</li>
</ul>
<p>Thanks for my proj manager i was given the opportunity to move to development</p>
<ul>
<li>and when my first day started as a developer: it gave off a different a flame</li>
<li>in terms of eagerness , the fire rekindle back in</li>
<li>and since then I promised myself to not keep my feelings and speak up to others to get insight and not be blinded by my own</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="support-vs-development">Support vs Development<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#support-vs-development">#</a></h2>
<h3 id="the-same">The Same<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#the-same">#</a></h3>
<p>actually Support and Dev aren&rsquo;t really that different, its funny how we are actually going through the same process:</p>
<ul>
<li>requirement gathering</li>
<li>forming the solution</li>
<li>development of solution</li>
<li>testing in differnet environment</li>
<li>get it approved from higher up</li>
<li>then get it moved to prod</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="the-difference">The Difference<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#the-difference">#</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Support
<ul>
<li>is more of a : fix the issue that is blocking the user to work</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Developer
<ul>
<li>to modify application to suite the users needs and wants</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="advantage-of-support">Advantage of Support<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#advantage-of-support">#</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Learn empathy with the user and learn how to build relations with user</li>
<li>Learn Data Correction and Data Analyzing
<ul>
<li>when i entered I had no former trainning of SQL but as Data was important for the user and for the support to understand on where it was changed or modified</li>
<li>it was a great asset to get use to SQL</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Learned debugging skills
<ul>
<li>when it comes to support, it isnt about memorizing every solution for every issue</li>
<li>but atually its about understanding the system and learning how to take advantage of tools to debug and pin point what caused the issue</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Learn the Importance of Documentation
<ul>
<li>as time to resolve issue is as important, documenting a possible to reoccur issue helps future support members to be able to answer right away or look in the right place</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="summary">Summary:<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#summary">#</a></h2>
<p>Despite I spent months in a role that I didn&rsquo;t like, but I&rsquo;m thankful I did</p>
<ul>
<li>as we should see every situation an opportunity to learn
<ul>
<li>as in some cases those dreams isn&rsquo;t reachable switch where when we want we can just switch right away</li>
<li>I was lucky I had a understanding project manager and had an open slot for Dev team</li>
<li>In cases of options are limited, I suggest learn as much in where you are
<ul>
<li>as I can assure you, you may say the learnings arent profitable</li>
<li>I can assure you you will learn something there that will be handy in your next ventures</li>
</ul>
</li>
